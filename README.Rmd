DOORMAT (**D**ata pr**O**cessor f**O**R i**M**p**A**c**T**) is the core R package which helps in compiling basic R functions to be able to analyze some standard outputs from the the International Model for Policy Analysis of Agricultural Commodities and Trade (IMPACT) model.

The IMPACT model was developed in the early 1990s to explore the long term challenges facing policymakers in reducing hunger and poverty in a sustainable fashion. The IMPACT model has been expanded and improved repeatedly to respond to increasingly complex policy questions and the state-of-the-art of modeling. [See documentation of most recent update](http://www.ifpri.org/publication/international-model-policy-analysis-agricultural-commodities-and-trade-impact-model-0).

The goal of DOORMAT is to to be able to setup some standar functions which will help in reading the outputs from a _gdx_ file belonging to the outputs of an IMPACT run. The package also provides a `buildPackage` utility which helps in compiling the packages from the IMPACT R-universe.
